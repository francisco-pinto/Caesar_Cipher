# Caesar_Cipher
A project made in C to encrypt wherever we want using Caesar_Cipher.

## Caesar's cipher Explanation
Caesar's cipher is a simple way to encrypt text, which takes the written words and adds a number of rotations (0 to 26), which causes each of the written letters to move in the alphabet the number of rotations chosen (Spaces don't count).  

Example:
  * Word: Teste
  * Number of rotation: 3
  * Final Result: Whvw
